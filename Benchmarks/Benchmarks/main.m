static NSString * const LevenshteinDescription =
@"In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for "
@"measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between "
@"two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or "
@"substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is named after Vladimir "
@"Levenshtein, who considered this distance in 1965";

static NSString * const DamerauLevenshteinDescription =
@"In information theory and computer science, the Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance (named after "
@"Frederick J. Damerau and Vladimir I. Levenshtein) is a distance (string metric) between two "
@"strings, i.e., finite sequence of symbols, given by counting the minimum number of operations "
@"needed to transform one string into the other, where an operation is defined as an insertion, "
@"deletion, or substitution of a single character, or a transposition of two adjacent characters. "
@"In his seminal paper, Damerau not only distinguished these four edit operations but also stated "
@"that they correspond to more than 80% of all human misspellings. Damerau's paper considered "
@"only misspellings that could be corrected with at most one edit operation.";
